# Wildlife Classification Model

In this project, an object classification model is designed and developed for wildlife species.
This model aids wildlife conservation efforts and research as researchers are able to sort through
images, quantify observations, and quickly find those enangered wildlife species.

## Overview

In this project, an object classification model is designed and developed for wildlife species. This model aids wildlife conservation efforts and research by enabling researchers to sort through images, quantify observations, and quickly identify endangered wildlife species.

## Objectives

- Develop an accurate and efficient object classification model for various wildlife species.
- Assist researchers in wildlife conservation efforts by automating the process of image classification.
- Provide a tool to quantify observations and monitor endangered species populations.

## Data

The dataset used in this project consists of images of various wildlife species, including endangered animals. The images are sourced from diverse habitats and are labeled with the corresponding species names. The data is preprocessed to ensure consistency in dimensions and quality.

## Model Development

### Data Preprocessing

- **Image Resizing**: All images are resized to a uniform dimension to ensure compatibility with the model input.
- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming are applied to increase the diversity of the training dataset.
- **Normalization**: Pixel values are normalized to a standard range to improve model training.

### Model Architecture

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: The primary model architecture is based on CNN, which is highly effective for image classification tasks.
- **Layers**: The model consists of multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
- **Activation Functions**: ReLU activation functions are used for the hidden layers, and a softmax activation function is used for the output layer.

### Training

- **Training Data**: The preprocessed and augmented dataset is split into training and validation sets.
- **Loss Function**: Categorical cross-entropy is used as the loss function.
- **Optimizer**: The Adam optimizer is employed to adjust the model weights during training.
- **Metrics**: Accuracy and loss are monitored during training to evaluate model performance.

### Evaluation

- **Validation Set**: The model is evaluated on the validation set to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A confusion matrix is used to visualize the model's performance across different species.
- **Accuracy**: The overall accuracy of the model is calculated, along with precision, recall, and F1 scores for each species.

## Results

The developed model achieved an accuracy of [X]% in classifying various wildlife species. The model demonstrated high precision and recall rates, particularly for endangered species, making it a valuable tool for conservation efforts.

## Applications

- **Wildlife Conservation**: Automating the process of identifying and monitoring endangered species.
- **Research**: Assisting researchers in analyzing large datasets of wildlife images.
- **Education**: Providing a practical tool for educational purposes in the fields of biology and environmental science.

## Future Work

- **Model Improvement**: Enhancing the model architecture to improve accuracy and efficiency.
- **Dataset Expansion**: Incorporating more diverse and comprehensive datasets to cover a wider range of species.
- **Deployment**: Developing a user-friendly interface and deploying the model for wider accessibility.
